            A hallmark of the Relay MAT program is the Master’s Defense, a capstone project at the end of year two in
            which you’ll reflect upon your evolution as a teacher and the growth of your PK-12 students.
            Having completed the program and practiced daily, you’ll graduate confident and ready to ensure that all students
            in your classroom are learning and growing, both academically and personally.

        <p> You’ll also develop pedagogical expertise in your chosen subject area and learn strategies to educate
            the whole child. The targeted feedback you receive from professors and peers, coupled with unparalleled
            opportunities for authentic practice, will enable you to hone your skills and elevate your craft.
